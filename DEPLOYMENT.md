  - Remotely_EnhancedFeatures__ScanIntervalMinutes=60
```

### SSL/HTTPS Setup
For production deployment:
1. Obtain SSL certificates
2. Place them in the `certs/` directory  
3. Update the docker-compose.yml file
4. Use a reverse proxy like Caddy or Nginx

## üîí Security Considerations

### Production Deployment
- Change default passwords
- Use proper SSL certificates
- Configure firewall rules
- Set up proper authentication
- Regular security updates

### Network Access
- By default, runs on localhost only
- For remote access, configure reverse proxy
- Use VPN for secure remote administration
- Monitor access logs regularly

## üì± Agent Installation

### Windows Agent
1. Go to http://your-server:5000
2. Click "Downloads"
3. Download and run the Windows installer
4. Follow the setup wizard

### Linux Agent
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
curl -s http://your-server:5000/Content/Install-Ubuntu-x64.sh | sudo bash

# Other distributions - check the Downloads page
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Container won't start:**
```bash
# Check logs
docker compose logs remotely-enhanced

# Restart services
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

**Can't access web interface:**
- Check if port 5000 is available
- Verify Docker is running
- Check firewall settings

**Agent won't connect:**
- Verify server URL is accessible from agent machine
- Check network connectivity
- Review agent logs in `%ProgramData%\Remotely\Logs`

### Getting Help
- Check the logs: `docker compose logs -f`
- Verify Docker status: `docker compose ps`
- Restart services: `docker compose restart`

## üöÄ Scaling for Production

### Performance Optimization
- Use SQL Server or PostgreSQL instead of SQLite
