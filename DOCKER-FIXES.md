# Docker Runtime Fixes Applied

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Missing Server.dll Error
**Problem**: Container was looking for `Server.dll` but the actual compiled assembly was `Remotely_Server.dll`
**Solution**: Updated Dockerfile entrypoint to use correct assembly name:
```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "Remotely_Server.dll"]
```

### 2. Proxy DNS Resolution Failures
**Problem**: Caddy proxy couldn't resolve `remotely-server` hostname during health checks
**Solutions Applied**:
- Fixed health check endpoint mismatch between Dockerfile (`/api/HealthCheck`) and Caddyfile (`/health`)
- Updated Caddyfile to use correct health endpoint: `/api/HealthCheck`
- Added health check dependency in docker-compose so proxy waits for server to be healthy
- Removed unnecessary SQL Server database dependency (using SQLite instead)

### 3. Container Startup Sequence
**Problem**: Proxy was trying to connect before server was fully started
**Solutions Applied**:
- Changed proxy dependency to wait for server health check: `condition: service_healthy`
- Increased health check start period to allow more time for server startup
- Created simplified docker-compose for easier testing

## Files Modified

### Server/Dockerfile
- Fixed entrypoint to use `Remotely_Server.dll`
- Maintained correct health check endpoint `/api/HealthCheck`

### docker-compose.yml
- Updated proxy dependency to use health check condition
- Removed SQL Server dependency (using SQLite)
- Fixed service naming and network configuration

### caddy/Caddyfile
- Updated health check URI to `/api/HealthCheck`

### docker-compose.simple.yml
- Fixed dockerfile path from `docker-compose/Dockerfile` to `Server/Dockerfile`
- Simplified configuration for testing (HTTP only, SQLite)
- Removed HTTPS and certificate requirements

### test-build.ps1
- Added interactive choice between simple and full stack deployment
- Enhanced diagnostics showing assembly name detection
- Better error messages and startup instructions

## Testing Instructions

### Option 1: Simple Testing (Recommended)
```powershell
.\test-build.ps1
# Choose option 1 for simple configuration
```

### Option 2: Manual Simple Build
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.simple.yml build remotely-server --no-cache
docker-compose -f docker-compose.simple.yml up -d
```

### Option 3: Full Stack
```bash
docker-compose build remotely-server --no-cache  
docker-compose up -d
```

## Access URLs

### Simple Configuration
- HTTP: http://localhost:5000

### Full Stack Configuration  
- HTTP: http://localhost:5000
- HTTPS: https://localhost:5001
- Proxy: http://localhost:80 (redirects to HTTPS)

## Health Check Verification

To verify the server is healthy:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/HealthCheck
```

Should return HTTP 204 (No Content) if healthy.

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:
1. Check container logs: `docker-compose logs remotely-server`
2. Verify build completed: `docker images | grep remotely`
3. Test health endpoint manually: `docker exec <container> curl localhost:5000/api/HealthCheck`
4. Check assembly files: `docker exec <container> ls -la /app/`

The fixes address the core runtime issues and provide multiple deployment options for different use cases.
